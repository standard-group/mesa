# Project Mesa

> [WARNING]
> This project is still in development and made by two dumb teenagers.

"Secure messenger for anyone who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate." is what project Briar said.
Mesa aims to complete Briar's vision.

Mesa is a messaging app designed for anyone who just need a little room to talk to their friends and family.
Unlike other/traditional messengers, Mesa doesnt't relay on one central server, but instead, it is federated and big (not yet gotta add this to the todo) social network with many servers and users.
